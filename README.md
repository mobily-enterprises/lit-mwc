# Welcome to The Platform

The Platform Elements is a minimalist set of themable elements for web designers and web developers.
There are three types of elements:

* `nn-` elements work _exactly_ like native elements (input, select, etc.)
* `en-` elements work like `nn` elements, but with enhancements (forms, advanced range, etc.)
* `ee-` elements are elements that do not resemble native ones (header, navbar, fab)

## Web designers

Web designers can use these elements by simply replacing the native ones.
